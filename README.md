Credit Risk Analysis Report

Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models in predicting credit risk. By distinguishing between healthy loans (low risk) and high-risk loans, financial institutions can better manage their lending practices and mitigate potential losses. This report presents a summary of the machine learning models used, their performance metrics, and recommendations based on the results.

Summary

The logistic regression model demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 99%. It is highly effective at predicting healthy loans with a precision and recall score of 1.00 and 0.99, respectively. For high-risk loans, the precision is 0.84, indicating that 84% of predicted high-risk loans were correctly classified, and the recall is 0.94, showing that the model successfully identified 94% of actual high-risk loans.

Given the model's reliability in classifying healthy loans and its reasonably strong performance with high-risk loans, this model is recommended for use by the company. It provides a robust balance of precision and recall, minimizing the risk of misclassification. However, continuous monitoring and potential improvements, such as addressing class imbalance or incorporating additional features, can further enhance its predictive capabilities.

If additional models were tested, include comparisons and justify why the logistic regression model remains the preferred choice or why another model might be more appropriate.
